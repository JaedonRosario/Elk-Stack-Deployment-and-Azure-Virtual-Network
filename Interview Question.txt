Suppose you have a firewall that's supposed to block SSH connections, but instead lets them through. How would you debug it?

In my project, I only allowed SSH traffic to the virtual machines that required it. These machines included the Jump Box provisioner and the Elk Stack server. If you try 
to connect to one of the other VMs, it will say the connection timed out, as the port 22 for SSH is not set to open. If one of the VM’s I set up to not allow SSH traffic 
suddenly accepted a connection, I would assume the source had something to do with my network security group in Azure. In the Azure UI, I would look under the network 
security group I’m using for the specific VM in question, in the inbound security rules pane. I would check to make sure that there is not a rule allowing traffic through 
SSH or port 22. If there was such rule, I would either remove it, or set it to deny traffic instead. To make sure my changes were effective, I would attempt to SSH into 
the VM giving issue and look for “connection timed out”. These steps should ensure that the VM can no longer be accessed through SSH connections. This solution will not 
prevent future changes to this rule however. To know if it changes in the future, I would set up a monitor that will log SSH connections to that VM.
